### Depending on the script there may be 81 versions of a single script
### This gives opportunity to make vague scripts which then specify
### and specify further to make use,
### e.g. Tax change could become defined with two more modifiers, happiness^
### From religous parties due to an Strip club tax(with other modifiers
### of relevance to this action), and the last one could perhaps be a time limit
### Considering on the things of action in these scripts, Time, Impact, Duration
### It may be worthwile to expand the amount of numbers used. Need to make a 
### function to peruse through this, first either the furthest left and across
### 
### If a script appears as follows: "A4"
### Script category A which arbitrarily in this case is Action is read, by
### by the program reading "A" and finding out in our scripts this means
### Action. Then it reads "4" and so it searches for the fourth script in Action
### Typically the program would read further but in this case it may be better
### to have each script have X000, rather than X0 and have it search for an
### empty case. This way if 0 is read it ends the search and uses the default
### variable.
