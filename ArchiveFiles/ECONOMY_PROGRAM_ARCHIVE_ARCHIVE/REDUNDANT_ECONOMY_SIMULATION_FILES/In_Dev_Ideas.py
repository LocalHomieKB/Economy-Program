#Idea:: simulation choices
#   #Fantasy kinggdom (special scrripts) Check 'Simulacra' paint 3d file
#   #Greece (Troika pprogram, historical events, high score gained by
# learning a strategy to solve the crisis)
#   #United Kingdom(Long drain, freeplay essentially,
#Mainly reoccuring events. Try to avoid collapse of diplomacy and of your
# country. Strong economics and trade routes, one invisible to China +
#All commonwealth to be programmed. Need a journal for approximate trade output
# relative to GDP and/or any other country statistics
# Each starts with 3(May actually change)
# neighbours for events, trade and scripts
# 
# Greece - (Main pop 60, , secondary pop 40, tertiary pop 20)
# Need a matrix to define popularity, money donations, skill, the level of 
# their influence in % to an industry, which depending on industry influence 
# affects level based modifiers, 3 or 4 levels for each.
# TROIKA DIRECTIVES -"As the EU's biggest scapegoat, Greece and its debt
# can be annihilated, as to free the EU powers from their burden" Germany focus
# to take out Greece, Semi pre determined with these faction alignments:
# Anti EU
# America(Supports UK)
# UK(support Greece and independence blah blah bull)
# Russia(Advisor to Germany:"
#Obviously unless some under the table fun happens Russia will bend
# over the EU and have its fun", Russia gains all Black sea related land(Helps
# them mess up Ukraine later) as well as Islands(Naval stuff). They may decide
# to promise not to intervene, volunteer or invade all with separate 
#reprecussions)
# Pro EU
# Germany(Leader of EU decisions and determines EU intervention, historical
# will be an EU invasion as the AI, much costlier decisions scaling in cost
# Based on time for recovery
# Italy(Reignition of the iron pact, neutrality or invades Germany for
# Austrian land, this Austria path prevents a Greece war but is difficult for
# Italy obviously as this action is deemed nefarious by all other factions)
#Millenium dawn mod? Is there a mod that features this)
# Neutral
# France(Initial or forever?)
# Additionally each country contains one or more unique resources with their
# own modifiers based on trade influence and/or investment. The UK resource
# would be Banking and cyber security, these act as subsidiary to service
# industry, so investment in service affects it based on an equal spread
# to all other service subsidiaries, direct investment is possible into a sub,
# however this can disproportionately affect other branches, so a spread 
# approach could be better.
# Simulacra(The Castle"Security above all, condenment down to persecution")
# - (main pop 100, Secessionist possible later). This may become a hoi4 map...
# Simulacra resources are gonna be typical fantasy shit, Magic stones in the 
# small independent nation, which can use this to embargo The Castle and block
# them out of using magic.
