#Not sure tbh...
# Many widgets also generate higher-level, semantic events 
# called virtual events. These are indicated by double angle 
# brackets around the event name, e.g., <<foo>>.
# You can define your own virtual events, which can be specific to your 
# application. This can be a useful way to keep platform-specific details
#  isolated in a single module while using the virtual event
#   throughout your application.
