"""A way to give population more depth:
def POPULATION_HIERARCHY(POPULATION):
Lower
Middle
Upper
A diagram on how they affect the government is on paper, these should dictate the variables they impact.
Hopefully this number of people in each hierachy will be dynamic, more on each individuals capabilities, than 
of the economy as a whole(quality of education, welfare etc).
A way to define certain policies would be useful, if visual easy, if written then there needs to be defined points, e.g
every 4 years a new government can be appointed, you choose the one with preferential policies, which would 
be based on what the party leans towards.
Conservative : corp tax down
Leftist : Human rights
