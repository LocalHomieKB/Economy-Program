# # The Wild West
# """
# """
# Let’s feed the numbers i have into godot and see what visuals i could get like 
# houses and stuff, simulate emigration through abandoned buildings
# the country is some landlocked state with a lot of nomadic movement

# actually maybe it’s just a town in the wild west, with a tavern, and movement is
# likely. Though if you provide the right
# services there’s a chance people coming through will settle, if they’re cowboys
# they’ll have specific traits and jobs
# that help your town uniquely to them. These guys can settle impromptu without 
# a house, but some types like accountants
# will need their own space. The game should start with a group of cowboys, 
# each can be assigned to any job and
# although
#     they’re jack of all trades there is some levity in their skills. For example
#      for 5 stats there’s maximum of 4 skill 
#     points up it could go down, at a chance of 1% that it could go this high, 
#     for example perception 9 instead of 5 
#     besides
#      any other changes would take a 1% odd. So after a while of operating and 
#      getting some immigrants you can build 
#      specialised buildings for them. ANd start replacing cowboys with 
#      profesional workers, after all not everyone wants
#       a knife wielding gunslinger as their barber. The growth and birth 
#       randomisation can be imported. The chances of 
#       immigration and all that simulation can also be imported, to at the 
#       beginning happen turn based with eventual 
#       real time changing with natural changes in migration, although most 
#       likely like this. You’re in the centre of 
#       5 towns around you, north, south east, south west, east and west, 
#       for someone from the north to go south east 
#       it is very likely they will go through you, if either your area is 
#       appealing enough or if it is too dangerous 
#       to move through the wild west they’ll stay with you, either for a
#        night or more, maybe convince them with some 
#       escorts to see if you could get that towns favour.

# step 1 - data based simulation of day by day changes in population, 
# most likely your base population of 10 doesn’t change much. and then up to 
# 6 groups at most(one from each town) could possibly stay, . maximum of 24 
# people let’s say. So at most your population would grow by 2.4 times base. 
# To appease a town you can offer them food. One unit of food satisfies one
#  person. So at most you could use up 24 units of food. How can food be obtained
#  , buying from caravans, hunting, donations, random events.

# Step 2 CDDA level graphics, if not DF style. The point of the game at this 
# point should be. To slowly specialise into one way, in order to appease a 
# specific town and guarantee survival of your town through trade incentives 
# from that town for a specific good as well as many other for cheaper as well, 
# e.g. food. After this you could try plundering rival towns in order to appease
#  the town your favourable with.


# it’s unlikely a caravan from one town should go all the way around, but if they
#  do you’re the one missing out on sweet money, goods and potential loot if 
#  they’re dumb enough( thievery aspect) Keep crime low, by keeping brigands 
#  at bay and having a police force to keep aware of bounties by either visiting
#  villages for info on criminals from either the police station, newspapers 
#  from outside the towns or through gossip with citizens(3 cards each a choice
#   that should be as dynamic as possible). This and attractiveness and as well
#    as interesting sites(tavern, escort building). Or even bribes can guarantee 
#    your town will stay alive, in the wild west

# T-Tavern
# H-Hotel
# P-(Hitching) post
# C-Camp
# R-Residential (home)
# C(-Commercial

# So one of the first processes would be Caravan movement, it would go as follows:

# (Town Name), (Town location) wants to trade with (TN), (TL). If adjacent it
#  simulates it. Trade Value for TN1 + 3(they sell and buy in one turn),Trade
#   value for TN2+2(they sell bormally but buy a limited amount from the caravan).

# # These decisions should be based on what the caravan either specifically 
# holds(Developed after it become a game) or predicted to (What the town produces
#  versus how much the other town needs it) If a towns specialty is oil gathering 
#  its priority to sell would be at some point 100% meaning up to 25% percent of
#   its holding caravan space would be designated for it. If another town is oil 
#   processing regardless of what size it has a high priority to buy this up to
#    the point where it has reserves for at least 7 turns. Trade happens every 
#    7 turns.

# Determined:
# Trade value earned is based on how much selling and buying is done. Simply that,
#  no minus values for selling more than buying, simple.
# Trade happens every 7 turns. They schedule imports 2 days before this? If we are
#  to simulate an external economy this would be needed to ensure these towns 
#  don’t die. So if we have two primary food producers, one oil producer, one 
#  construction material producer, and one population producer . 


# This is the order the code needs to be in, at least this early in.
# 	1.	movement of people in and out of town 7am
# 	2.	movement within town 7am
# 	3.	movement of people within town out of town 7am
# 	4.	Caravan events 7-12pm
# 	5.	Item gathering events 7-2pm
# 	6.	Town planning(building + emergency events)2-5pm
# 	7.	final movement out of town 2-7pm
# 	8.	Final movement into town 5-10pm

# Chance of a caravan being caught should have a number peaking between 8pm and 
# 6am.  lowest between 12pm and 3pm And a static 10% chance for all other hours. 
# CHance of succes should be based on each event, although some shouldn’t be all 
# bad. Think oregon valley. There should be a choice to designate a patrol of 
# some size to decrease chance of bad events in one or all 5 paths between your 
# town and others. Sometimes you may get missions to patrol these when there’s 
# rare cargo, important people or simply a relationship boost at hand.

# operator is called.
# __contains__(self,y) y in x When x is a collection you can test to see if y is in it.
# __eq__(self,y) x == y Returns True or False depending on the values of x and y.

# __hash__(self) hash(x) Returns an integral value for x.
# __int__(self) int(x) Returns an integer representation of x.
# __iter__(self) for v in x Returns an iterator object for the sequence x.
# __le__(self,y) x <= y Returns True or False depending on the values of x and y.
# __len__(self) len(x) Returns the size of x where x has some length attribute.
# __lt__(self,y) x<y Returns True or False depending on the values of x and y.
# __mod__(self,y) x%y Returns the value of x modulo y. This is the remainder of x/y.
# __mul__(self,y) x*y Returns the product of x and y.
# __ne__(self,y) x != y Returns True or False depending on the values of x and y.
# __neg__(self) -x Returns the unary negation of x.

# __repr__(self) repr(x) Returns a string version of x suitable to be evaluated by the eval
# function.
# #Necessary for re-evaluation by the computer

# __setitem__(self,i,y) x[i] = y Sets the item at the ith position in x to y.

# Goals for this program:
# Your success in the simulation is based on your total score as well as your final year score
# Do better in these than in a simulation with no changes added, and you will be a winner
# The only variable that needs changing should be the OS directory. Usually a subfolder exists
# below the economy folder but my understanding of GitHub prevents me from doing this.
# Any questions should be directed to my GitHub project. Constructive criticism is appreciated
# especially from a data analysis standpoint as that is the direction this project is going towards
# The average score for the game is equal to playing it with no tax tampering whatsoever
# This is equal to:TOTAL_SCORE = 90348800000 VALUE_OF_TOWN = 1129360000
